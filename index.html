        <div class="subtext">Such an amazing place and amazing staff! 
            Extremely helpful and such wonderful work! They brought my 
            grandparents back to life. My grandfather passed away when I 
            was only a year old and they allowed me to see my grandfather 
            in video like he was right there. I got to hear his voice which
             was so wonderful it is beyond words! If you need any vintage recordings 
             transferred to DVDs or flash drive, you will not regret coming here. 
             I also very much enjoy the vintage room right when you walk in!</div>

        <div class="subtext">I would highly recommend memory transfers... 
            The customer service was impeccable... And having my memories put on 
            DVD and USB is a treasure. My family and I sat last night and watched and 
            it was so nice to see memories from 30 years ago come back to life. 
            Thank you for providing such a valuable service. I also have to add that 
            when I received my DVDs they had printed some of the pictures and included them in 
            the DVD artwork. Loved it so much!!!</div>

        <div class="subText">Memory Transfers did a great job transferring vcr to flash drive.
            What a memorable Christmas for my familyâ€”my twenty something sons saw footage they 
            had never seen before! Each son was given their own stick, they really treasure the memories. 
            Great service.</div>
